          Section 13A-6-240
          <br />
          Distributing a private image with intent to harass, threaten, coerce,
          or intimidate the person depicted.
          <br />
          (a) A person commits the crime of distributing a private image if he
          or she knowingly posts, emails, texts, transmits, or otherwise
          distributes a private image with the intent to harass, threaten,
          coerce, or intimidate the person depicted when the depicted person has
          not consented to the transmission and the depicted person had a
          reasonable expectation of privacy against transmission of the private
          image.
          <br />
          (b) For purposes of this section, private image means a photograph,
          digital image, video, film, or other recording of a person who is
          identifiable from the recording itself or from the circumstances of
          its transmission and who is engaged in any act of sadomasochistic
          abuse, sexual intercourse, sexual excitement, masturbation, breast
          nudity, as defined in Section 13A-12-190, genital nudity, or other
          sexual conduct. The term includes a recording that has been edited,
          altered, or otherwise manipulated from its original form.
          <br />
          (c)(1) For purposes of this section, a reasonable expectation of
          privacy includes, but is not limited to, either of the following
          circumstances:
          <br />
          a. The person depicted in the private image created it or consented to
          its creation believing that it would remain confidential.
          <br />
          b. The sexual conduct depicted in the image was involuntary.
          <br />
          (2) There is no reasonable expectation of privacy against the
          transmission of a private image made voluntarily in a public or
          commercial setting.
          <br />
          (d) It is a defense to distributing a private image if the
          distribution of the private image was made in the public interest,
          including, but not limited to, the reporting of unlawful conduct; the
          lawful and common practices of law enforcement, legal proceedings, or
          medical treatment; or a bona fide attempt to prevent further
          distribution of the private image.
          <br />
          (e) A violation of this section is a Class A misdemeanor. A subsequent
          adjudication or conviction under this section is a Class C felony.
