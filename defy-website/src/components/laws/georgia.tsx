        a. It is the policy of this state to exercise its jurisdiction over
        crime and persons charged with the commission of crime to the fullest
        extent allowable under, and consistent with, the Constitution of this
        state and the Constitution of the United States.

        b. Pursuant to this policy, a person shall be subject to prosecution in
        this state for a crime which he commits, while either within or outside

        accountable, if:
        <br />
        1. The crime is committed either wholly or partly within the state;
        <br />
        2. The conduct outside the state constitutes an attempt to commit a
        crime within the state; or

        3. The conduct within the state constitutes an attempt to commit in
        another jurisdiction a crime under the laws of both this state and the
        other jurisdiction.

        which is an element of the crime or the result which is such an element
        occurs within the state. In homicide, the “result” is either the act
        which causes death or the death itself; and, if the body of a homicide
        victim is found within this state, the death is presumed to have
        occurred within the state.
        <br />
        d. A crime which is based on an omission to perform a duty imposed by
        the law of this state is committed within the state, regardless of the
