          modiﬁcation, alteration, or adaptation, depicts a realistic version of
          an identiﬁable person:

          1. With the nude body parts of another person as the nude body parts
          of the identiﬁable person;
          <br />
          2. With computer-generated nude body parts as the nude body parts of

          identiﬁable person did not engage.
          <br />
          (b) “Identiﬁable person” means a person who is recognizable as an
          actual person by the person’s face, likeness, or other distinguishing
          characteristic, such as a unique birthmark, or other recognizable

          (c) “Nude body parts” means the human male or female genitals, pubic

          breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any portion thereof
          below the top of the nipple; or the depiction of covered male genitals
          in a discernibly turgid state. The term does not under any

          <br />
          (d) “Promote” means to issue, sell, give, provide, lend, mail,
          deliver, transfer, transmit, transmute, publish, distribute,
          circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, send, post, share, or
          advertise or to offer or agree to do the same.

          consent to or participate in the creation or promotion of the
          material, or that the person or persons depicted did not actually
          perform the actions portrayed, is not a defense and does not relieve a
