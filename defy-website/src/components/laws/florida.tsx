          or human beings and animals, that exhibits uncovered human genitals or
          the pubic region in a lewd or lascivious manner, or that exhibits
          human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if completely
          and opaquely covered.
          <br />
          (22) “Simulated” means the explicit depiction of conduct described in
          subsection (19) which creates the appearance of such conduct and which

          (23) “Specific sexual activities” includes the following sexual

          775.082 Penalties; applicability of sentencing structures; mandatory
          minimum sentences for certain reoffenders previously released from
          prison.—
          <br />
          (1)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a person who has been
          convicted of a capital felony shall be punished by death if the
          proceeding held to determine sentence according to the procedure set
          forth in s. 921.141 results in a determination that such person shall
          be punished by death, otherwise such person shall be punished by life
          imprisonment and shall be ineligible for parole.
          <br />
          (b)1. A person who actually killed, intended to kill, or attempted to
          kill the victim and who is convicted under s. 782.04 of a capital
          felony, or an offense that was reclassified as a capital felony, which
          was committed before the person attained 18 years of age shall be
          punished by a term of imprisonment for life if, after a sentencing
          hearing conducted by the court in accordance with s. 921.1401, the
          court finds that life imprisonment is an appropriate sentence. If the
          court finds that life imprisonment is not an appropriate sentence,
          such person shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of at least 40
          years. A person sentenced pursuant to this subparagraph is entitled to
          a review of his or her sentence in accordance with s. 921.1402(2)(a).
          <br />
          2. A person who did not actually kill, intend to kill, or attempt to
          kill the victim and who is convicted under s. 782.04 of a capital
          felony, or an offense that was reclassified as a capital felony, which
          was committed before the person attained 18 years of age may be
          punished by a term of imprisonment for life or by a term of years
          equal to life if, after a sentencing hearing conducted by the court in
          accordance with s. 921.1401, the court finds that life imprisonment is
          an appropriate sentence. A person who is sentenced to a term of
          imprisonment of more than 15 years is entitled to a review of his or
          her sentence in accordance with s. 921.1402(2)(c).
          <br />
          3. The court shall make a written finding as to whether a person is
          eligible for a sentence review hearing under s. 921.1402(2)(a) or (c).
          Such a finding shall be based upon whether the person actually killed,
          intended to kill, or attempted to kill the victim. The court may find
          that multiple defendants killed, intended to kill, or attempted to
          kill the victim.
          <br />
          (2) In the event the death penalty in a capital felony is held to be
          unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court or the United States
          Supreme Court, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously
          sentenced to death for a capital felony shall cause such person to be
          brought before the court, and the court shall sentence such person to
          life imprisonment as provided in subsection (1). No sentence of death
          shall be reduced as a result of a determination that a method of
          execution is held to be unconstitutional under the State Constitution
          or the Constitution of the United States.
          <br />
          (3) A person who has been convicted of any other designated felony may
          be punished as follows:
          <br />

          (I) A term of imprisonment for life; or

          <br />
          b. For a life felony committed on or after July 1, 2008, which is a
          person's second or subsequent violation of s. 800.04(5)(b), by a term

          punished by a term of imprisonment for life or by a term of years
          equal to life imprisonment if the judge conducts a sentencing hearing
          in accordance with s. 921.1401 and finds that life imprisonment or a

          b. A person who did not actually kill, intend to kill, or attempt to

          accordance with s. 921.1402(2)(c).
          <br />
          c. The court shall make a written finding as to whether a person is
          eligible for a sentence review hearing under s. 921.1402(2)(b) or (c).
          Such a finding shall be based upon whether the person actually killed,
          intended to kill, or attempted to kill the victim. The court may find
          that multiple defendants killed, intended to kill, or attempted to
          kill the victim.
          <br />
          6. For a life felony committed on or after October 1, 2014, which is a

          2. Notwithstanding subparagraph 1., a person convicted under s. 782.04
          of a first degree felony punishable by a term of years not exceeding
          life imprisonment, or an offense that was reclassified as a first
          degree felony punishable by a term of years not exceeding life, which
          was committed before the person attained 18 years of age may be
          punished by a term of years equal to life imprisonment if the judge
          conducts a sentencing hearing in accordance with s. 921.1401 and finds
          that a term of years equal to life imprisonment is an appropriate
          sentence.
          <br />
          a. A person who actually killed, intended to kill, or attempted to
          kill the victim and is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more

          eligible for a sentence review hearing under s. 921.1402(2)(b) or (c).
          Such a finding shall be based upon whether the person actually killed,
          intended to kill, or attempted to kill the victim. The court may find
          that multiple defendants killed, intended to kill, or attempted to
          kill the victim.
          <br />
          (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), a person convicted of an
          offense that is not included in s. 782.04 but that is an offense that
          is a life felony or is punishable by a term of imprisonment for life
          or by a term of years not exceeding life imprisonment, or an offense

          imprisonment of more than 20 years is entitled to a review of his or
          her sentence in accordance with s. 921.1402(2)(d).

          <br />
          (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the operation

          <br />
          within 3 years after being released from a state correctional facility
          operated by the Department of Corrections or a private vendor, a
          county detention facility following incarceration for an offense for
          which the sentence pronounced was a prison sentence, or a correctional
          institution of another state, the District of Columbia, the United
          States, any possession or territory of the United States, or any
          foreign jurisdiction, following incarceration for an offense for which
          the sentence is punishable by more than 1 year in this state.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. “Prison releasee reoffender” also means any defendant who commits
          or attempts to commit any offense listed in sub-subparagraphs
          (a)1.a.-r. while the defendant was serving a prison sentence or on
          escape status from a state correctional facility operated by the
          Department of Corrections or a private vendor or while the defendant
          was on escape status from a correctional institution of another state,
          the District of Columbia, the United States, any possession or
          territory of the United States, or any foreign jurisdiction, following
          incarceration for an offense for which the sentence is punishable by
          more than 1 year in this state.
          <br />
          3. If the state attorney determines that a defendant is a prison
          releasee reoffender as defined in subparagraph 1., the state attorney
          may seek to have the court sentence the defendant as a prison releasee
          reoffender. Upon proof from the state attorney that establishes by a
          preponderance of the evidence that a defendant is a prison releasee
          reoffender as defined in this section, such defendant is not eligible
          for sentencing under the sentencing guidelines and must be sentenced
          as follows:
          <br />
          a. For a felony punishable by life, by a term of imprisonment for
          life;
          <br />
          b. For a felony of the first degree, by a term of imprisonment of 30
          years;

          years; and

          years.
          <br />
          (b) A person sentenced under paragraph (a) shall be released only by
          expiration of sentence and shall not be eligible for parole, control
          release, or any form of early release. Any person sentenced under
          paragraph (a) must serve 100 percent of the court-imposed sentence.
          <br />
          (c) Nothing in this subsection shall prevent a court from imposing a
          greater sentence of incarceration as authorized by law, pursuant to s.
          775.084 or any other provision of law.
          <br />
          (d)1. It is the intent of the Legislature that offenders previously
          released from prison or a county detention facility following
          incarceration for an offense for which the sentence pronounced was a
          prison sentence who meet the criteria in paragraph (a) be punished to
          the fullest extent of the law and as provided in this subsection,
          unless the state attorney determines that extenuating circumstances
          exist which preclude the just prosecution of the offender, including
          whether the victim recommends that the offender not be sentenced as
          provided in this subsection.
          <br />
          2. For every case in which the offender meets the criteria in
          paragraph (a) and does not receive the mandatory minimum prison
          sentence, the state attorney must explain the sentencing deviation in
          writing and place such explanation in the case file maintained by the
          state attorney.
          <br />
          (10) If a defendant is sentenced for an offense committed on or after
          July 1, 2009, which is a third degree felony but not a forcible felony
          as defined in s. 776.08, and excluding any third degree felony
          violation under chapter 810, and if the total sentence points pursuant
          to s. 921.0024 are 22 points or fewer, the court must sentence the
          offender to a nonstate prison sanction. However, if the court makes
          written findings that a nonstate prison sanction could present a
          danger to the public, the court may sentence the offender to a state
          correctional facility pursuant to this section.
          <br />
          (11) The purpose of this section is to provide uniform punishment for
          those crimes made punishable under this section and, to this end, a
          reference to this section constitutes a general reference under the
          doctrine of incorporation by reference.
