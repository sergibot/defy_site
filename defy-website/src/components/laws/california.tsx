          permission from the person appearing in the material to publish by any
          means or post the material on an internet website.
          <br />
          (3) The person appearing in the material waived any reasonable

          notice.
          <br />
          (d) In addition to any other relief available at law, the court may
          order equitable relief against the person violating subdivision (a),
          including a temporary restraining order, or a preliminary injunction
          or a permanent injunction ordering the defendant to cease distribution
          of material. The court may grant injunctive relief maintaining the
          confidentiality of a plaintiff using a pseudonym as provided in
          subdivision (f).
          <br />
          (e) The court may also grant, after holding a properly noticed

          <br />
          (f) (1) A plaintiff in a civil proceeding pursuant to subdivision (a),
          may proceed using a pseudonym, either John Doe, Jane Doe, or Doe, for
          the true name of the plaintiff and may exclude or redact from all
          pleadings and documents filed in the action other identifying

          pseudonym and excluding or redacting identifying characteristics as
          provided in this section shall file with the court and serve upon the
          defendant a confidential information form for this purpose that

          excluded or redacted characteristics confidential.
          <br />
          (2) In cases where a plaintiff proceeds using a pseudonym under this
          section, the following provisions shall apply:
          <br />
          (A) All other parties and their agents and attorneys shall use this
          pseudonym in all pleadings, discovery documents, and other documents
          filed or served in the action, and at hearings, trial, and other court
          proceedings that are open to the public.
          <br />
          (B) (i) Any party filing a pleading, discovery document, or other
          document in the action shall exclude or redact any identifying
          characteristics of the plaintiff from the pleading, discovery
          document, or other document, except for a confidential information
          form filed pursuant to this subdivision.
          <br />
          (ii) A party excluding or redacting identifying characteristics as
          provided in this section shall file with the court and serve upon all
          other parties a confidential information form that includes the
          plaintiff's name and other identifying characteristics excluded or
          redacted. The court shall keep the plaintiff's name and excluded or
          redacted characteristics confidential.
          <br />
          (C) All court decisions, orders, petitions, discovery documents, and
          other documents shall be worded so as to protect the name or other
          identifying characteristics of the plaintiff from public revelation.
          <br />

          can be discerned.
          <br />
          (B) "Online identifiers" means any personally identifying information
          or signifiers that would tie an individual to a particular electronic
          service, device, or Internet application, website, or platform

          (4) The responsibility for excluding or redacting the name or
          identifying characteristics of the plaintiff from all documents filed
          with the court rests solely with the parties and their attorneys.
          Nothing in this section requires the court to review pleadings or

          grants a plaintiff's motion to seal records pursuant to Chapter 3 of
          Division 4 of Title 2 of the California Rules of Court.
          <br />
          (g) In an action pursuant to this section, the plaintiff shall state
          in the caption of the complaint "ACTION BASED ON CIVIL CODE SECTION
          1708.85."
          <br />

      48a. (a) In any action for damages for the publication of a libel in a
      daily or weekly news publication, or of a slander by radio broadcast,
      plaintiff shall only recover special damages unless a correction is
      demanded and is not published or broadcast, as provided in this section.
      Plaintiff shall serve upon the publisher at the place of publication, or
      broadcaster at the place of broadcast, a written notice specifying the
      statements claimed to be libelous and demanding that those statements be
      corrected. The notice and demand must be served within 20 days after
      knowledge of the publication or broadcast of the statements claimed to be
      libelous.
      <br />
      (b) If a correction is demanded within 20 days and is not published or
      broadcast in substantially as conspicuous a manner in the same daily or
      weekly news publication, or on the same broadcasting station as were the
      statements claimed to be libelous, in a regular issue thereof published or
      broadcast within three weeks after service, plaintiff, if he or she pleads
      and proves notice, demand and failure to correct, and if his or her cause
      of action is maintained, may recover general, special, and exemplary
      damages.
      <br />
      Exemplary damages shall not be recovered unless the plaintiff proves that
      defendant made the publication or broadcast with actual malice and then
      only in the discretion of the court or jury, and actual malice shall not
      be inferred or presumed from the publication or broadcast.
      <br />
      (c) A correction published or broadcast in substantially as conspicuous a
      manner in the daily or weekly news publication, or on the broadcasting
      station as the statements claimed in the complaint to be libelous, before
      receipt of a demand for correction, shall be of the same force and effect
      as though the correction had been published or broadcast within three
      weeks after a demand for correction.
      <br />
      (d) As used in this section, the following definitions shall apply:
      <br />
      (1) "General damages" means damages for loss of reputation, shame,
      mortification,
      <br />
      (2) "Special damages" means all damages that plaintiff alleges and proves
      that he or she has suffered in respect to his or her property, business,
      trade, profession, or occupation, including the amounts of money the
      plaintiff alleges and proves he or she has expended as a result of the
      alleged libel, and no other.
      <br />
      (3) "Exemplary damages" means damages that may in the discretion of the
      court or jury be recovered in addition to general and special damages for
      the sake of example and by way of punishing a defendant who has made the
      publication or broadcast with actual malice.
      <br />
      (4) "Actual malice" means that state of mind arising from hatred or ill
      will toward the plaintiff; provided, however, that a state of mind
      occasioned by a good faith belief on the part of the defendant in the
      truth of the libelous publication or broadcast at the time it is published
      or broadcast shall not constitute actual malice.
      <br />
      (5) "Daily or weekly news publication" means a publication, either in
      print or electronic form, that contains news on matters of public concern
      and that publishes at least once a week.
