          Given the scale of the problem, and the explosive, complex nature of
          the 'Generative AI' industry-subsidized DFIAM creation process, is
          there any fix to this situation?

          At DefyAbuse, we have been building a simple, holistic solution: we
          have created a map of the online territory occupied by DFIA and
          similar harms. Bringing together discussion forums, DFIAM-as-a-Service
          websites, 'Generative AI' APIs, chatbot-creation platforms, affiliate
          referral code distributors, and other diverse online loci, the map
          that we have spent five years charting illustrates the ecosystem that
          enables and monetizes the creation and distribution of DFIAM at
          immeasurable scale.

          Yes, we are. We advise the heads of the UK's National Police Chiefs'
          Council and National Crime Agency as well as the UK Government's Department
          for Science, Innovation and Technology, and the UK Home Office's Interpersonal
          Abuse and Violence Against Women and Girls units.

          However, the laws are weak and new and are not effective upon the
          ecosystem. For instance, in the UK the Online Safety Act did criminalize the creation and distribution of image-based sexual abuse material as of 31st January 2023

          {/* For a multiplicity of reasons, the law has not been brought in to tackle DFIA, with very rare exception.

<li>
1 new laws - nobody knows how they will be interpreted in court, no precedent! so would rely on copyright etc - self-perpetuating cycle...
</li>

<li>
  nobody waants to 
</li>
<li>
2 individual victim-survivors, like with rape cases, will be re-traumatized throughout the justice system, with no way of proving that it wasn't them in the DFIAM... and no assurance from authorities
</li>

<li>
3 powerful victim-survivors will be putting themselves in the crosshairs of misogyny for standing up for themselves - and also, will invite swathes of DFIAM targeting them. the less said the better - like with bullies.
</li>

an eg of all of the above is the way that the state has to step in to mitigate individual harm. making laws does not fix the problem! we have laws! using them isn't practical !

eg california had one of first df laws: https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/ag-data-dive/california-deepfake-laws-first-in-country-to-take-effect

but this law was not used in huge court case recently, where the city of san fran sued 10 df companies
https://sfcityattorney.org/2025/06/02/city-attorney-shuts-down-10-websites-that-create-nonconsensual-deepfake-pornography/







          There are many ways of prospering from this harm which the law hasn't
          come close to criminalizing: chiefly, referral codes. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Indeed, although DFIAM creation may sometimes be criminalised by laws,
          the creation of DFIAM is almost always hidden by the DFIA websites
          (which purposefully do not keep activity logs) and so offenders
          acquire the DFIAM without anybody knowing, leaving no evidence with
          which to enforce the law.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, and crucially, the hidden nature of this online process
          makes it impossible to know, without running the DFIAM creation
          websites, how much DFIAM is being created. All we can know for certain
          is how many DFIA websites are online, and unless somebody conducts
          research as we have been doing that information will also be lost to
          time. */}
